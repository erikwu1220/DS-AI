Training is done in jupyter notebooks. Each notebook should be able to be run, but please be careful to specify "train=True" to actually train a model. Beware of:
- Long run times
- Saving new, wrongly trained models. The different models were sometimes created in the same notebook by just respecifying a few parameters.
