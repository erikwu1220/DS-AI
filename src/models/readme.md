This folder contains all of the model classes. Files with the _source_-suffix indicate code that was directly obtained from a different source and subsequently modified to fit our needs. The sources are mentioned in the acknowledgements. Some of the models may be very similar to eachother, in which cases the names should be indicative of the differences. This was done to avoid having to use a lot of if-statements when incorporating and testing different model features.
